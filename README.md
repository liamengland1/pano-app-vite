- Basic panorama viewer using Three.js  -  [Demo](https://pano-app.liamengland.com/)
    - Quick project that I was inspired to work on to allow more flexibility when embedding 360-degree images (panoramas) in ArcGIS Storymaps
    - Allows users to view and interact with 360-degree panoramas, and to configure and customize the viewer, "clamping" the view to a specified range of angles.
    - Built using Three.js and a React + TypeScript + Vite frontend
    - Created with ArcGIS Storymaps in mind, but can be used elsewhere
